# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
Models are Ruby classes that store/validate data, perform the business logic, and crunch numbers.
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The controller parses user requests/data submissions/cookies/sessions and then tells the model to do something. Once models have performed the task, the controller returns the response body (HTML, XML) and metadata to the server.
```

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
The router points us to the appropriate controller.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
First, a browser is going to make a GET request to read a website. A web server receives that request and uses a router to determine the appropriate controller. The server uses the dispatcher to create a new controller. The controller will ask a model to get the website. The model will talk to the database and get that website. The model will pass that information back to the controller. The controller sends the response body and metadata back to the web server, which then relays that message back to the client. 
```
